## Day-by-Day Coding Overview

1. **Puzzle 1 - Length limits on messaging platforms**: Fairly simple problem of determining costs of message based on number of characters and bytes, after I got passed the initial problem of UTF-8 format encoding
2. **Puzzle 2 - Detecting gravitational waves**: Simple timezone counter, but did enjoy the shifting part of the timezones.
3. **Puzzle 3- Unicode Passwords**: Validating passwords to ensure they meet a certain set of criteria.
4. **Puzzle 4- A trip around the world**: Calculating travel time, fairly simple time math using datetime and zoneinfo
5. **Puzzle 5- Don't step in it...**: Fairly simple but definitely helped by python's handling of emojis, alternative handling in Java or C# would be interesting.
6. **Puzzle 6- Mojibake puzzle dictionary**: Fairly simple problem of matching words, once you make sure you have copied the input correctly. Took a while to realize that.
7. **Puzzle 7- The audit trail fixer**: Handling timezones and daylight saving shifts, definitely a guiding direction.
8. **Puzzle 8- Unicode passwords redux**: Validating passwords fairly simple, once I figured out how to normalise the letter.
9. **Puzzle 9- Nine Eleven**: Identifying the correct date format used, and highlighting the importance of a single global standard
10. **Puzzle 10- Unicode passwords strike back!**: Validating a series of login attempts by checking passwords, using the bcrypt algorithm.
11. **Puzzle 11- Homer's Cipher**: Decoding a coded message that was fairly simple, except for the way sigma is handled still confused about that.
12. **Puzzle 12- Sorting It Out**: Sorting it out a list of names in a phone directory
13. **Puzzle 13- Gulliver's puzzle dictionary**: Fairly similar to Puzzle 6, except for identifying the correct encoding.
14. **Puzzle 14- Metrification in Japan**: Quite fun learning about a different number system, however, debugging and handling of fractions took a second.
15. **Puzzle 15- 24/5 support**: Create a schedule to map global office schedules and customer requests, and calculate required overtime.
16. **Puzzle 16- 8-bit unboxing**: Play a modern version of the PIPES game from the original DOS system, connecting pipes and fixing all leaks with the minimum number of rotations.
