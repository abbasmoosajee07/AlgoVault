#### *A mechanical mind. A forgotten land. A quest for beauty in numbers.*

A different spin on fairly basic coding problems, by using a mechanical Turing Machine, as the logic center, to solve different quests.
## Turing Machine
- Turing Machine built and being used for this challenge hosted in [Repo](https://github.com/abbasmoosajee07/TuringMachineSim)
- Interactive simulator hosted in [Github Page](https://abbasmoosajee07.github.io/TuringMachineSim/)

## Challenges
- **Quest 00 - Binary Increment**: Increase the number represented on a tape by one.
- **Quest 01 - Unary Addition**: Probably the most basic of mathematical functions, addition yet can be made so complicated.
- **Quest 02 - Unary Even Odd**: Determining if a unary number is even or odd, essentially solved by switching between Odd/Even until printing final state at end.
- **Quest 03 - Binary Increment**: Increase a binary number by 1. The first solution where you have to evaluate between rules and steps
- **Quest 04 - Unary Multiplication**: Multiply two unary numbers to produce a result tape.
